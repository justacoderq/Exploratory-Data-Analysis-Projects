# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Plotting Skills

## Overview
This repository includes module assignments showcasing various skills in **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Plotting Techniques**. It covers a wide range of tasks, including data cleaning, feature selection, statistical analysis, and creating insightful visualizations. The projects demonstrate practical applications of EDA and data visualization to uncover trends and patterns in real-world datasets.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Techniques**:
  - Data cleaning (handling missing data, outliers, etc.)
  - Feature selection and transformation
  - Statistical analysis (mean, median, mode, standard deviation)
  - Correlation analysis
  - Identifying trends and patterns in the data
  
- **Plotting and Visualization**:
  - Scatter plots for analyzing relationships between variables
  - Box plots for visualizing distributions and outliers
  - Histograms to understand data distribution
  - Regression lines and other model-based visualizations
  - Visualizations for comparing categorical and numerical variables

## Projects Included
- **Avalanche Data Analysis**: Scraping and analyzing avalanche data from the Utah Avalanche Center website, with a focus on the relationship between avalanche width and depth.
- **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Demonstrating techniques for handling missing or inconsistent data, including imputation strategies and transformations.
- **Visualizations**: Creating various plots to represent the data effectively, including the use of regression lines and correlation analysis.
